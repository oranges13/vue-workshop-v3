// #Exercise 2
// Summary: In this exercise we are going to improve our Vue knowledge by expanding the previous component and add further features
// Story: As an user of the website, I would like to have access to a component that will show me a list of all the jokes.
//        This component should also show me a loading message while the jokes are retrieved.

// This component will feature:
// - Async data loading
// - Conditional component loading
// - use of multiple vue directives
// - async component loading
// - use of properties

//Steps
// - async import our ExcerciseOne component
// - Create basic html and load a single "ExerciseOne"
// - Async load our list of jokes in mounted lifecycle
// - Use v-for to load multiple Instances of ExerciseOne
// - Pass the properties down from the current component to "excerciseOne"
// - Change ExerciseOne to accept properties instead than load its own data (youneed to leave the property used for the hide and show of the punch line)
// - Create a "loading" HTML and add v-if to make sure there is no error while data is loaded

// import { fetchJokes } from '@/assets/jokes.js';
